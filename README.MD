## 🎯 Problem-Solving Strategies

### Simplify First

> **George Pólya:** _"If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
I am struggling to understand [Topic]. Create a strictly simpler version of this problem
that retains the core concept, help me solve that, and then bridge it back to the original.
```

**💡 Alternative Prompt:**

```
I am stuck on [Problem]. Don't simplify it for me yet. Instead, ask me 3 guiding
questions that help me strip away constraints until I arrive at the 'Toy Version'
of this problem myself. Once I solve the Toy Version, guide me in adding the
constraints back one by one.
```

---

### Multiple Approaches

> **George Pólya:** _"It is better to solve one problem five different ways, than to solve five problems one way."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
Provide 5 distinct methods to prove or solve [Problem/Theorem].
```

**💡 Alternative Prompt:**

```
Solve [Problem] using three radically different paradigms (e.g., Geometric,
Algebraic, and Probabilistic). For each solution, assign a 'Cognitive Cost' score
(how hard is it to set up?) and an 'Insight Score' (how much does it reveal about the nature of the problem?).
```

---

### Decomposition

> **René Descartes:** _"Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
Decompose [Complex Theorem/concept] into a hierarchical list of atomic prerequisites
I need to learn first.
```

---

### The Rising Sea Method

> **Alexander Grothendieck:** _"Don't try to crack the nut with a hammer; let the nut soak in water until it opens naturally."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
Instead of giving me the brute-force solution to [Problem], teach me the general theory
and context surrounding it so the solution feels obvious.
```

**💡 Alternative Prompt:**

```
I have a specific hard problem: [Problem]. Do not solve it yet. Let's use Grothendieck's
'Rising Sea' method. Let's build up the general theory and definitions surrounding this
problem so thoroughly that the solution eventually becomes trivial/obvious. Start filling
the 'sea' of theory.
```

---

### Inversion Principle

> **Carl Gustav Jacobi:** _"Invert, always invert."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
Explain [Function/Operation] by looking at its inverse. What does working backward tell
us about the forward process?
```

---

### Problem Formulation

> **David Hilbert:** _"A perfect formulation of a problem is already half its solution."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
Rewrite the following problem in clearer, deeper formulations and show how each
formulation hints at a method of solution: [Problem].
```

---

### Reflection & Improvement

> **George Pólya:** _"Look back on your work. How could it be better?"_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
I have found the solution to this problem: [Solution]. Now, facilitate a 'Look Back' phase.
Critique my method. Was it the most efficient way? Is there a more elegant approach?
How can we generalize this result to a broader class of problems?
```

---

### Working Backwards

> **Carl Friedrich Gauss:** _"I have had my results for a long time: but I do not yet know how I am to arrive at them."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
I intuitively believe the answer to [Problem] is [Answer], but I can't prove it.
Act as Gauss. Help me work backwards from this result. What conditions must be true
for this result to hold? Let's construct the bridge from the destination back to the start.
```

---

## 🎨 Intuition vs. Logic

### Discovery Through Intuition

```

---

### Historical Insights

> **Jacques Hadamard:** _"Logic merely sanctions the conquests of the intuition."_

**💡 Prompt:**

```
Walk me through the 'aha!' moments in history that led to the discovery of [Concept]
before the formal logic was finalized.

### Logical Hygiene

```

---

### Geometric Intuition

**💡 Prompt:**

```
My solution to [Problem] looks messy and complicated. Help me refactor it to be more elegant.
```

---

### Nature's Beauty

Create a schematic diagram of how the components relate. Then, let's substitute simpler

relates to other objects in its category (inputs and outputs). Draw the
commutative diagram using text-based art (ASCII).
```

**💡 Alternative Prompt:**

```
Don't tell me what the elements of this set are. Tell me about the arrows (morphisms)

Which transformations leave the equation unchanged, and what Conserved Quantity
(via Noether's Theorem) corresponds to each symmetry?
```
